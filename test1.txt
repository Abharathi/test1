Write a function that accepts a string as a parameter. If the length of the string is less than or equal to twenty characters long, return the string concatenated with itself (string + string). If the string is more than twenty characters long, return the first half of the string.
Write a function that accepts a string and a single character as inputs. Write a loop that iterates over the string, and returns the position of the first occurrence of the specified character. If the character is not found, tell that to the user by returning "Character not found!".
Make a function that takes a string and returns that string where the first half is capitalized, and the second half is lower cased. (If the string length is odd, capitalize the shorter of the first half.)
capilizeAndLowercase("Hello") // => "HEllo"
capilizeAndLowercase("Hello World") // => "HELLO world"
Create a new JavaScript file and put these two arrays at the beginning. You will write a single function that performs many operations on them.
var fruit = ["banana", "apple", "orange", "watermelon"];
var vegetables = ["carrot", "tomato", "pepper", "lettuce"];
After every command, use console.log() to inspect your arrays. A good way to do that is to do something like:
console.log("fruit: ", fruit);
console.log("vegetables: ", vegetables);
Remove the last item from the vegetable array.
Remove the first item from the fruit array.
Find the index of "orange."
Add that number to the end of the fruit array.
Use the length property to find the length of the vegetable array.
Add that number to the end of the vegetable array.
Put the two arrays together into one array. Fruit first. Call the new Array "food".
Remove 2 elements from your new array starting at index 4 with one method.
Reverse your array.
Turn the array into a string and return it.
If you've done everything correctly, the last step should print the following string to the console:
3,pepper,1,watermelon,orange,apple
Given an array of potential voters, return an object representing the results of the vote
Include how many of the potential voters were in the ages 18-25, how many from 26-35, how many from 36-55, and how many of each of those age ranges actually voted. The resulting object containing this data should have 6 properties. See the example output at the bottom.
var voters = [
    {name:'Bob' , age: 30, voted: true},
    {name:'Jake' , age: 32, voted: true},
    {name:'Kate' , age: 25, voted: false},
    {name:'Sam' , age: 20, voted: false},
    {name:'Phil' , age: 21, voted: true},
    {name:'Ed' , age:55, voted:true},
    {name:'Tami' , age: 54, voted:true},
    {name: 'Mary', age: 31, voted: false},
    {name: 'Becky', age: 43, voted: false},
    {name: 'Joey', age: 41, voted: true},
    {name: 'Jeff', age: 30, voted: true},
    {name: 'Zack', age: 19, voted: false}
];

function voterResults(arr) {
   // your code here
}

console.log(voterResults(voters)); // Returned value shown below:
/*
{ youngVotes: 1,
  youth: 4,
  midVotes: 3,
  mids: 4,
  oldVotes: 3,
  olds: 4 
}
*/
